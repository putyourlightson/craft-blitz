Please [read this article](https://putyourlightson.com/articles/critical-update-for-a-blitz-blunder) to find out whether the issue affects your site, and what you should do.

### Fixed

- Fixed the default cache control header values that were inadvertently set to incorrect values ([learn more](https://putyourlightson.com/articles/critical-update-for-a-blitz-blunder)).

## 4.3.1 - 2023-02-10

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in which saving elements without going through a draft were not triggering cache refreshes ([#474](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-blitz/issues/474)).

## 4.3.0 - 2023-02-07

### Added

- Replaced the `Guzzle Warmer` with the `HTTP Generator`.
- Replaced the `Local Warmer` (experimental) with the `Local Generator` (stable).
